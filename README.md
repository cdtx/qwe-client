QPython Web Editor command line client
=======================================

QPython looks awesome to developp under Android with python, from simple script to a complet project.

However I had never found a proper working environment for it, develop in local, use git, deploy in a second, etc.

Until I discover a sample built-in script : qedit4web.py
Web running it, it launches a web application, that invites us to connect http://192.xxx, and opens a simple text editor, with an EXECUTE button, almost awesome ! 
A minimal reverse engineering to list the available commands, and here is qwe-client.
A command line tool for :
- Create a script or a project
- Deploy files
- Execute

I'm now able to develop on my PC, archive in github, eventually test, then deploy projects on my phone.
